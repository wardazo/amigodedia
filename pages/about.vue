              Our goal is to help locally owned restaurants reopen post-Covid 19
              19 by providing them with a platform to market their business
              locally, while encouraging everyday people to reconnect with their
              their friends over lunch. It’s a way to stimulate local economies
              economies and rebuild local communities.

              In Spain alone, over 300,000 restaurants have been closed, putting
              putting an estimated 1.7 million jobs at risk. 95% of the sector
              are small businesses, employing less than 10 staff. In the US, an
              an estimated 7 million low-wage restaurant workers will be made
              unemployed in the coming 3 months. Over 70% of all US restaurants
              restaurants are small locally-owned businesses, who now find
              themselves at risk.

              This matters to us because we have a lot of love and respect for
              the small businesses and restaurant workers who have heroically
              taken on much of the financial cost of containing Covid-19.
            </p>
            <p>
              The impact of community shutdown will be economically devastating
              to many of these businesses in the short and long term, and to
              their hourly wage employees.
            </p>
            <p>
              Those less impacted by the virus want to help support these
              businesses, but don’t know how. Grassroots efforts thus far have
              been well-meaning, but limited.
            </p>
            <p>
              However in the coming weeks and months life will restart! People
              will are aching to reconnect, leave the home, and help to rebuild
              their communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s channel this burst of energy into this program which
              rekindles connection while benefiting the small business owners
              impacted in the restaurant industry.

              Menu del Día (Menu of the Day) is the Spanish tradition of
              offering a full meal at a discounted price for lunch from a
              pre-selected menu. e.g. Starter, Main, Dessert and Drink for a
              fixed price. The format is flexible but usually includes great
              value for the customer while moving product for the restaurant.
